        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>In recent years, the automotive industry has witnessed a significant shift towards sustainable transportation solutions, driven by concerns over environmental sustainability and the need to reduce carbon emissions (European Environment Agency, 2016).
        According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), road transport electrification on a global scale is expected to unlock substantial emission reductions in the coming decades (IEA, 2024). By 2035, the switch to electric vehicles (EVs) is projected to avoid over 2 gigatons (Gt) of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions on a well-to-wheels basis. While there are concerns about additional emissions from electricity generation for EVs, the net savings from transitioning to electric vehicles far outweigh any potential drawbacks.
        The introductory dashboard offers a comprehensive overview of EV adoption in Europe, highlighting key insights and trends based on the latest data. The left side features a map showing the production share of EVs as a percentage of projected EV production by 2027, with a color gradient from bright orange to bright blue indicating low to high market share. Notably, Norway, and Europe in general exhibit high EV production shares. The right side highlights Europe and displays a bar chart comparing the percentage of EV and non-EV car sales in 2023, with Norway leading in adoption, followed closely by the Netherlands. Users can interact with the dashboard to highlight EV or non-EV sales, or view both for a comprehensive comparison.</p>

            <h2>EV sales in the world</h2>
            <p>Previous visualizations showed the projected ev production in 2027 in the world as well as the EV and non-EV car sales in Europe in the year 2023. It is also useful for the public to see and policymakers to be informed by how the EV sales worldwide change over time, therefore predicting the trend in the following years. Although the information provided is for the worldwide EV sales, each country can still gain insight and adopt their own policies locally. The graph shows the EV sales from 2017 to 2022, indicating a clear rising trend in the sales over the years. In 2022 the sales worldwide has reached 10 million. In the following visualizations we will delve into the reasons for this uprising trend and provide more detailed analysis for the information hidden behind the data.</p>

            <h2>Government spending on EV</h2>
            <p>The visualization in these two graphs show how the government spending is increasing overall in past years. One could easily rationalize that with more money people are more willing to purchase EV, therefore causing the general rising trend in the EV sales worldwide. However, the average spending per EV refutes this saying by demonstrating a downward trend. Together with the previous visualization users could notice that with less incentive given for one EV by the government, the overall sales of EV has still been increasing in the past few years, suggesting that monetary factors are not, or at least not the only factors influencing the EV sales.</p>

            <h2>Reasons for people' EV purchase</h2>
            <p>This visualization reveals the fundamental reasons concerning people’s purchase willingness of EV. On the left side the graph describes the reasons inhibiting purchase of EV. It is evident that the worry about the lack of charging stations in the city takes up the first place whereas the lack of charging infrastructure at work or home is less of a concern. On the contrary, the graph on the right illustrates the reasons motivating the purchase of EV. It is also interesting to see that the monetary incentive, which one may assume to be the most influential factor, only takes the third place in the middle. While environmental concerns are the most motivating factor encouraging people’s purchase. And in general all the factors can be categorized to 4 types: environmental concern, monetraty incentives, charging infrustracture and upfront costs.</p>

            <h2>Financial incentive for EV purchase in selected European countries</h2>
            <p>After consideration, we opted for 4 countries that are representative in Europe to make instructions for the policymakers to speed up the transformation in Europe. As a forerunner, Norway is chosen for its high EV adoption as illustrated in the beginning. Belgium and the Netherlands are also chosen since the Netherlands have a lot in common with Belgium while taking up a much higher proportion of EV sales than Belgium. Spain is also chosen as a southern European country and for its rich data availability.</p>
