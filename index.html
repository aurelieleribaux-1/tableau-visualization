        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>In recent years, the automotive industry has witnessed a significant shift towards sustainable transportation solutions, driven by concerns over environmental sustainability and the need to reduce carbon emissions (European Environment Agency, 2016).
According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), road transport electrification on a global scale is expected to unlock substantial emission reductions in the coming decades (IEA, 2024). By 2035, the switch to electric vehicles (EVs) is projected to avoid over 2 gigatons (Gt) of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions on a well-to-wheels basis. While there are concerns about additional emissions from electricity generation for EVs, the net savings from transitioning to electric vehicles far outweigh any potential drawbacks.
The introductory dashboard offers a comprehensive overview of EV adoption in Europe, highlighting key insights and trends based on the latest data. The left side features a map showing the production share of EVs as a percentage of projected EV production by 2027, with a color gradient from bright orange to bright blue indicating low to high market share. Notably, Norway, and Europe in general exhibit high EV production shares. The right side highlights Europe and displays a bar chart comparing the percentage of EV and non-EV car sales in 2023, with Norway leading in adoption, followed closely by the Netherlands. Users can interact with the dashboard to highlight EV or non-EV sales, or view both for a comprehensive comparison.
